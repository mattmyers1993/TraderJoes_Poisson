    "# How I Order Chips for Trader Joe's Using Python, Poisson Distributions, and Power BI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for checking out my project! I work at Trader Joe's and am responsible for ordering inventory for the chip section. This is a fun probability challenge as each day I have to gauge how much product to order in order to meet customer demand, without ordering too much so that our backstock room overflows with blue corn tortilla chips. \n",
    "\n",
    "At work, I have access to the average sales per product, which gives me a  sense for what the rough middle of a probability distribution is. The problem is we sell X amount on average but we could sell more than that or less than that on any given day. I knew I could get a more nuanced view using a Poisson Distribution which gives a probability distribution based on an independent event's average rate like an average sale at a retail store. I'll dive into the nitty gritty below, but the Poisson Distribution allows me to see where the likely edge of what possible sales are, so that I can maximize the probability we have enough product to meet demand, without ordering more inventory than is ever likely to be sold. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in this notebook is to make a lookup table that creates all the different permutations of how many cases I can order, the resulting probability we meet customer demand, and the expected backstock left over. \n",

    "In this project, I used the poisson.cdf and poisson.pmf methods to build two complementary lookup tables designed to support smarter inventory planning. The first table calculates the probability that a given number of cases on hand will meet daily demand, using the cumulative distribution function to estimate service levels across a range of average sales and order quantities. The second table uses the probability mass function to calculate the likelihood of each possible leftover amount, along with the expected number of leftover cases. Together, these tables form the backbone of a dynamic Power BI model that allows users to input average sales and visually explore the trade-off between stocking too little and too much, all grounded in a probabilistic understanding of real-world demand variation."
